# Whalesper

We have previously worked together and launched the product, Whalesper, at March 2017. It is originally an AI-powered local news aggregation iOS app. So far, we harvested nearly 31K users around Toronto area and ranked fourth in App Store Toronto search result.

The Whalesper app now uses NLP(natural language processing) to auto-classify around 200 feeds every day into target topics and make summarization for user.
